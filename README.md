# About me
Hi, my name is Martyna Jońska and I am really passionate about testing. I have some experience in UX, which only showed me that maybe design is not my path, but rather testing is :) In my free time I like to stay active, either by going for a walk, or enyojing salsa classes. During longer evenings I love to solve puzzles and read a book.
